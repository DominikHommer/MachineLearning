# Machine Learning Course Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) that showcase the projects and exercises I've completed as part of my Machine Learning course. Each notebook is a comprehensive guide through the concepts and applications I've learned, designed to demonstrate my understanding and skills in the field of Machine Learning.

## Overview ðŸš§

The content of this repository is organized into several directories, each representing a key area of Machine Learning that we've explored. Currently available for viewing are:

- `Linear_Models`: Notebooks in this directory focus on linear regression, logistic regression, and other linear models for both regression and classification tasks. It includes detailed explorations of various linear approaches in machine learning, showcasing their application on real-world datasets.

- `Classification`: This directory features notebooks that explore various classification algorithms beyond linear models, such as kNN, support vector machines (SVMs) etc. Projects within this directory demonstrate the classification of different datasets, ranging from fruit classification to spam email detection, using advanced machine learning techniques.

While the above directories are currently prepared and available for GitHub, the repository is a work in progress ðŸš§. More content is stored locally, awaiting preparation for GitHub. In the future, the repository may expand to include a variety of projects, not limited to but potentially involving:

- Projects utilizing for machine learning experiments and demonstrations.
- Further exploration into advanced classification and regression models, providing deeper insights into predictive analytics.
- Broadening the scope to include various machine learning techniques and their practical applications across different domains.

The aim is to gradually release more projects as they are prepared for GitHub, offering a comprehensive look at machine learning's diverse techniques and applications. Stay tuned for future updates and new additions to the repository.


## Getting Started

To get started with these notebooks, you'll need to have Jupyter installed on your machine. You can install Jupyter using Anaconda or with pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

Once Jupyter is installed, you can run the following command in the terminal at the root of this repository to start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a new browser window or tab displaying the Jupyter Dashboard, from where you can navigate to and open any notebook in this repository.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this repository are to:

1. Document my learning progress and understanding of Machine Learning concepts.
2. Serve as a portfolio of my work for future reference and for sharing with potential employers or collaborators.
3. Provide a resource for others learning Machine Learning, offering practical examples and insights.
